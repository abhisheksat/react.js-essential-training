React from 'react';
ReactDOM from 'react-dom';


Creating a React Element

//	a sample style that will be applied as attribute of the element
var style = {
	backgroundColor: 'red',
	color: 'blue',
	fontFamily: 'Arial'
}

//	defining a react element
const hello = React.createElement(
	'h1',	//	This is the type of element, essentially the tag
	{id: 'hello', className: 'header', style: style},	//	these are attribute of the element
	'React and Hello World'	//	If there are any nested elements, they go here. In this case, the innerHTML of the element
)

//	Render the created element on DOM with this function in the selected elementById
ReactDOM.render(
	hello,
	document.getElementById('root')
)


Instead of calling the createElement each time, we can use JSX: JavaScript as XML
for that we will remove hello element built separately and put in the HTML tags directly in render

ReactDOM.render(
	<div>
		<h1 id="heading">Hello World</h1>
		<p>We are glad you are here!</p>
	</div>,
	document.getElementById('root')
)
